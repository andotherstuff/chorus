# hashtags nostr react ui complete
Hashtag functionality implementation completed in Chorus Nostr client:

1. ‚úÖ NoteContent.tsx - Hashtag rendering and clickable links
2. ‚úÖ CreatePostForm.tsx - Hashtag extraction and 't' tags on post creation
3. ‚úÖ ReplyForm.tsx - Hashtag extraction and 't' tags on replies  
4. ‚úÖ Hashtag.tsx page - Dedicated hashtag feed page with filtering
5. ‚úÖ EditProfileForm.tsx - Added 'about' field with hashtag support in bio

The hashtag system now works end-to-end:
- Users can type #hashtags in posts, replies, and profile bios
- Hashtags are automatically extracted and stored as 't' tags in Nostr events
- Hashtags are rendered as clickable links in content
- Clicking hashtags navigates to dedicated hashtag feed pages
- Hashtag feeds show all posts containing that specific hashtag
- Profile bios support hashtags for discoverability

All components compile successfully and the implementation follows Nostr protocol standards.

# workflow git shorthand process
User workflow shorthand: When user says "you know what to do" or "ykwtd" it means:
1. Create a new branch
2. Commit the changes  
3. Create a pull request

This is the standard workflow for completing feature implementation.

# trending hashtags feature-request discovery
User wants trending hashtag functionality added to the Chorus Nostr client. This would show popular/frequently used hashtags to help users discover what's trending in the network.

# nip29-groups documentation relay-based-groups
NIP-29 Groups Implementation - IMPORTANT: Always consult relay_nip29_notes.md for detailed documentation about:

- Relay-specific event kinds (9xxx for user actions, 39xxx for relay-generated)
- NIP-42 authentication requirements
- Group creation, management, and member permissions
- EnhancedNostrProvider routing logic for NIP-29 events

Key implementation files:
- /src/components/EnhancedNostrProvider.tsx - Handles NIP-29 relay routing and NIP-42 auth
- /src/hooks/useNip29Groups.ts - Fetches NIP-29 groups from relays
- /src/lib/group-utils.ts - Unified Group type handling for both NIP-72 and NIP-29

2. Test create/join/manage flow for NIP-29 groups
3. Test reports, invites, member management
