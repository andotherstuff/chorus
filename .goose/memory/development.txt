# hashtags nostr react ui complete
Hashtag functionality implementation completed in Chorus Nostr client:

1. ✅ NoteContent.tsx - Hashtag rendering and clickable links
2. ✅ CreatePostForm.tsx - Hashtag extraction and 't' tags on post creation
3. ✅ ReplyForm.tsx - Hashtag extraction and 't' tags on replies  
4. ✅ Hashtag.tsx page - Dedicated hashtag feed page with filtering
5. ✅ EditProfileForm.tsx - Added 'about' field with hashtag support in bio

The hashtag system now works end-to-end:
- Users can type #hashtags in posts, replies, and profile bios
- Hashtags are automatically extracted and stored as 't' tags in Nostr events
- Hashtags are rendered as clickable links in content
- Clicking hashtags navigates to dedicated hashtag feed pages
- Hashtag feeds show all posts containing that specific hashtag
- Profile bios support hashtags for discoverability

All components compile successfully and the implementation follows Nostr protocol standards.

# workflow git shorthand process
User workflow shorthand: When user says "you know what to do" or "ykwtd" it means:
1. Create a new branch
2. Commit the changes  
3. Create a pull request

This is the standard workflow for completing feature implementation.
