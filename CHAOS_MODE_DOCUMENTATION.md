# üå™Ô∏è Chaos Mode & Experimental Features Documentation

Welcome to the wild side of NostrGroups customization! This documentation covers the experimental and chaos features that allow group owners to completely break conventional design rules and create truly unique (and potentially chaotic) experiences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: PROCEED WITH CAUTION

These features are designed to push the boundaries of web design and user experience. They can make your group:
- Completely unusable
- Cause motion sickness
- Break accessibility standards
- Confuse or frustrate users
- Create performance issues

**Use these powers responsibly!**

## üé≠ Chaos Mode Features

### Core Chaos Settings

#### Chaos Mode Toggle
- **What it does**: Enables the core chaos engine
- **Effects**: Random element transformations, color changes, and unpredictable behavior
- **Intensity**: Adjustable from 1-10 (10 being complete mayhem)

#### Random Elements
- **Random Colors**: Elements randomly change colors throughout the session
- **Random Fonts**: Text randomly switches between different font families
- **Random Sizes**: Elements randomly scale up and down

  50% { transform: rotate(180deg) scale(0.9); }
  75% { transform: rotate(270deg) scale(1.2); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg) scale(1); }
}

@keyframes chaos-float {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0px) translateX(0px); }
  25% { transform: translateY(-20px) translateX(10px); }
  50% { transform: translateY(10px) translateX(-15px); }
  75% { transform: translateY(-15px) translateX(5px); }
}
```

### JavaScript Effects

- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## üéÆ Usage Guidelines

### For Group Owners

#### Start Small
1. Begin with subtle effects (small rotations, gentle floating)
2. Test with a few trusted members first
3. Gradually increase intensity based on feedback
4. Always provide a way to disable effects

#### Consider Your Audience
- **Gaming Communities**: May enjoy high chaos
- **Professional Groups**: Stick to subtle effects
- **Art Communities**: Experiment with visual effects
- **Accessibility**: Always consider users with motion sensitivity

#### Best Practices
1. **Preview Everything**: Use preview mode extensively
2. **Test on Mobile**: Effects may behave differently
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for slowdowns
4. **Provide Warnings**: Let users know about motion effects
5. **Have an Exit Strategy**: Know how to quickly disable effects

### For Developers

#### Adding New Effects
1. Add settings to `CustomizationSettings` interface
2. Update default settings in both components
3. Add UI controls in the appropriate tab
4. Implement CSS generation logic
5. Add JavaScript effects to `chaos-effects.ts`

#### Performance Optimization
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Throttle event listeners
- Clean up resources properly
- Test on low-end devices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Effects Not Working
