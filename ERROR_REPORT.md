# Chorus Project Error Report

## Summary

The project builds successfully (`npm run ci` passes), but there are several issues that need attention.

## âœ… Fixed Issues (in this branch)

### 1. Critical React Hook Violations - ALL FIXED âœ…
- **CreatePostForm.tsx:91** - Fixed by moving `useAuthor` before conditional return
- **ReplyForm.tsx:100** - Fixed by moving `useAuthor` before conditional return  
- **PostList.tsx:763-764** - Fixed by using existing `ReplyCount` component

### 2. TypeScript `any` Types - PARTIALLY FIXED âœ…
Fixed 4 out of 5 occurrences:
- **NutzapButton.tsx:119** - Added window type augmentation
- **NutzapList.tsx:21** - Changed to `Proof[]` type
- **GroupNutzapList.tsx:88** - Changed to `NostrEvent` type
- **PostList.tsx:830** - Fixed by removing `as any`

### 3. Missing Dependencies - FIXED âœ…
- **NutzapCard.tsx:250** - Added `formatAmount` to useEffect dependencies

## ðŸ”´ Remaining Issues

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities (2 moderate)

**Issue**: Vulnerable versions of `esbuild` dependency
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Details**: esbuild <=0.24.2 enables any website to send requests to the development server
- **Fix**: Run `npm audit fix --force` (will upgrade to vite@6.3.5, which is a breaking change)

### 2. ESLint Warnings (25 total, down from 33)

**Remaining Issues:**
- Empty interface declarations (2 errors)
- Additional `any` types in other files (5 errors)
- Lexical declarations in case blocks (2 errors)
- Conditional useEffect call (1 error)
- Fast refresh warnings for constant exports (multiple warnings)

### 3. Performance Issues

**Large Bundle Size:**
- Main JS bundle: 1,457.42 kB (425.18 kB gzipped)
- **Warning**: Chunks larger than 500 kB after minification
- **Recommendations**:
  - Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
  - Use manual chunks in Vite configuration
  - Lazy load heavy components

### 4. Project Configuration Issues

**Package.json naming:**
- Project name is "mkstack" but appears to be a Nostr client called "Chorus"
- Consider updating the package name for clarity

## Progress Summary

### Fixed in this branch âœ…:
- **8 errors resolved** (from 33 to 25)
- All critical React Hook violations fixed
- Most TypeScript `any` types replaced with proper types
- Missing useEffect dependency fixed

### Still needs attention ðŸ”´:
- Security vulnerabilities (requires Vite upgrade)
- Performance optimizations (bundle size)
- Remaining ESLint warnings
- Project naming consistency

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure fixes don't break functionality
2. Consider addressing security vulnerabilities (may require testing with Vite 6.x)
3. Implement code splitting for performance
4. Clean up remaining ESLint warnings
