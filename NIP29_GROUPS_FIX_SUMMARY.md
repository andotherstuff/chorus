# NIP-29 Groups Loading Fix Summary

## Issue
NIP-29 groups were not showing on the groups page at http://localhost:8080/groups.

## Root Cause
The `useUnifiedGroupsWithCache` hook was importing `useNip29Groups` from the wrong file (`./useNip29Groups` instead of `./useNip29GroupsWithCache`), which resulted in calling the hook without any relay URLs. Without relay URLs, the hook would return an empty array.

## Fix Applied

1. **Updated Import Statement**
   - Changed import in `useUnifiedGroupsWithCache.ts` from:
     ```typescript
     import { useNip29Groups } from './useNip29Groups';
     ```
   - To:
     ```typescript
     import { useNip29Groups } from './useNip29GroupsWithCache';
     ```

2. **Updated NIP-29 Relay List**
   - Updated the `DEFAULT_NIP29_RELAYS` in `useNip29GroupsWithCache.ts` to include only working relays:
     - `wss://communities.nos.social`
     - `wss://groups.fiatjaf.com`
     - `wss://pyramid.fiatjaf.com`
     - `wss://nostrelites.org`
   - Documented non-working relays in comments for future reference

3. **Added Debug Component**
   - Created `Nip29GroupsDebug.tsx` component to help debug NIP-29 group loading
   - Temporarily added to Groups page to verify groups are loading correctly

## Verification

1. Tested relay connections using a Node.js script:
   - Confirmed `wss://communities.nos.social` has 4 groups
   - Confirmed `wss://groups.fiatjaf.com` has 8 groups
   - Other relays either have no groups or connection issues

2. Build verification:
   - `npm run build:dev` completes successfully with no TypeScript errors

## How It Works Now

1. When the Groups page loads, `useUnifiedGroupsWithCache` is called
2. This hook now correctly imports and calls `useNip29Groups()` from `useNip29GroupsWithCache`
3. The `useNip29Groups()` function uses the `DEFAULT_NIP29_RELAYS` array
4. Groups are fetched from all configured relays in parallel
5. Results are cached and deduplicated
6. Both NIP-72 and NIP-29 groups are displayed together on the Groups page

## Next Steps

1. Remove the debug component from Groups page after verifying groups load correctly
2. Monitor relay health and update the relay list as needed
3. Consider adding a relay health check mechanism
4. Add user feedback when NIP-29 groups are loading
