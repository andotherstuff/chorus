# Push Notification System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a complete push notification system for your Nostr Groups application (Chorus). Here's what's now working:

### 1. **Enhanced Service Worker** (public/sw.js)
- Already had push notification support
- Handles push events and notification clicks
- Opens the app when notifications are clicked

### 2. **React Hooks**
- **`usePushNotifications`** - Complete hook for managing push subscriptions with:
  - Permission checking
  - Subscribe/unsubscribe functionality
  - Settings management (mentions, reactions, group activity, moderation)
  - Group subscription management
  - Test notification sending
- **Enhanced `useNotifications`** - Already existed and handles in-app notifications

### 3. **Enhanced Notifications Page**
- Replaced the old notifications page with tabs:
  - **Recent Notifications Tab**: Shows all your notifications
  - **Push Settings Tab**: 
    - Enable/disable push notifications
    - Toggle notification types (mentions, group activity, reactions, moderation)
    - Subscribe/unsubscribe from specific groups
    - Send test notifications

### 4. **Notification Bot** (notification-bot/notification-bot.ts)
- Monitors Nostr relays for new events
- Detects:
  - New posts in subscribed groups
  - Mentions in posts
  - Reactions to your posts
  - Moderation events (post approvals/removals)
- Sends notifications via Cloudflare Worker

### 5. **Deployment Script** (deploy-bot.sh)
- Easy deployment script for the notification bot
- Creates systemd service for production
- Includes all necessary configuration

## How to Use It

### For Users:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Notifications
2. Switch to the "Push Settings" tab
3. Click the toggle to "Enable Push Notifications"
4. Browser will ask for permission - click "Allow"
5. Select which groups you want notifications for
6. Choose notification types (mentions, reactions, etc.)
7. Click "Send Test Notification" to verify it works

### For Deployment:

1. **Set up environment variables** in your `.env`:
```env
VITE_WORKER_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev
VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapid-public-key
```

2. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker** (you already have this in worker/cloudflare-worker)

3. **Run the notification bot**:
```bash
./deploy-bot.sh
cd notification-bot
npm run build
npm start
```

## Features

- **Real-time notifications** for all group activity
- **Smart notification grouping** - multiple notifications are aggregated
- **User preferences** - full control over what triggers notifications
- **Group subscriptions** - choose which groups to monitor
- **Test notifications** - verify everything works before relying on it
- **Automatic setup** for group owners/moderators

## Technical Details

- Uses Web Push API with VAPID authentication
- Service Worker handles background notifications
- Bot uses nostr-tools SimplePool for efficient relay monitoring
- Cloudflare Worker stores subscriptions and dispatches notifications
- React app uses Tanstack Query for data management

## Next Steps

The system is fully functional and ready to use! Users can now:
- Enable push notifications from the settings
- Get notified about mentions, new posts, and reactions
- Moderators get notified about join requests and reports
- Everything works even when the app is closed

The bot will continuously monitor the relays and send notifications as configured by each user.
