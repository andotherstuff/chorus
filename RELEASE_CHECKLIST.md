### 3. **Production Deployment**
```bash
# Frontend
npm run build

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Enable notifications on Chrome desktop
- [ ] Enable notifications on Chrome Android
- [ ] Enable notifications on Safari iOS (if supported)
- [ ] Post in a group → members get notified
- [ ] Mention someone → they get notified
- [ ] React to post → author gets notified
- [ ] Disable/re-enable notifications
- [ ] Test with multiple devices per user

### Edge Cases
- [ ] User leaves group → stops getting notifications
- [ ] User banned from group → stops getting notifications
- [ ] Group deleted → notifications stop
- [ ] Worker down → graceful degradation
- [ ] Bot crashes → auto-restart
- [ ] Rate limit exceeded → proper queueing

### Load Testing
- [ ] 100 concurrent users
- [ ] 1000 notifications per minute
- [ ] Large groups (1000+ members)
- [ ] Multiple bots if needed
