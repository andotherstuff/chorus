# +chorus App Testing Summary

**App URL**: http://10.255.12.206:8080/  
**Date**: June 1, 2025  
**Testing Method**: Automated checks + Manual test plan

## Testing Completed âœ…

### 1. Server & Infrastructure Testing
- âœ… Development server is running and accessible
- âœ… All core app resources loading correctly (Vite, React, CSS)
- âœ… PWA manifest and service worker are available
- âœ… API endpoints responding (OPTIONS /api/upload returns 204)

### 2. Test Artifacts Created
1. **Comprehensive Test Plan** (`TEST_REPORT_APP.md`)
   - Detailed overview of all features
   - Expected behaviors documented
   - Testing recommendations

2. **Feature Test Checklist** (`test-results/feature-checklist.md`)
   - Step-by-step test cases for all features
   - User flows for authentication, groups, posts, etc.
   - Edge cases and error scenarios

3. **API Test Script** (`test-app-api.sh`)
   - Automated checks for server endpoints
   - Resource loading verification
   - Security header checks

## Manual Testing Required ðŸ”„

Due to the nature of Nostr apps requiring browser extensions and relay connections, the following features need manual testing:

### High Priority:
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login with Nostr extension (Alby, nos2x)
   - Account switching
   - Profile creation/editing

2. **Group Functionality**
   - Create NIP-72 public communities
   - Create NIP-29 private groups
   - Join existing groups
   - Group discovery and search

3. **Content Creation**
   - Post text content
   - Upload and display media
   - Reply threads
   - Post moderation flow

### Medium Priority:
4. **Member Management**
   - Role assignments (owner, admin, member)
   - Join request approvals
   - Ban/unban functionality

5. **Notifications**
   - Push notification setup
   - Real-time updates
   - Notification badges

6. **Wallet Features**
   - Cashu wallet creation
   - Send/receive nutzaps
   - Transaction history

### Low Priority:
7. **Mobile Experience**
   - Responsive design
   - PWA installation
   - Touch interactions

## Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Set up test environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install a Nostr browser extension
   # Create test accounts with known nsec keys
   # Connect to test relays
   ```

2. **Follow the test checklist**:
   - Use `test-results/feature-checklist.md` as guide
   - Document any issues found
   - Take screenshots of key flows

3. **Test with real data**:
   - Create actual groups
   - Post real content
   - Interact with other users

### Automated Testing Setup:
1. **Playwright E2E tests**:
   ```javascript
   // Example test structure
   test('user can create a group', async ({ page }) => {
     // Login flow
     // Navigate to create group
     // Fill form and submit
     // Verify group created
   });
   ```

2. **Mock Nostr environment**:
   - Set up test relays
   - Create deterministic test data
   - Mock browser extension APIs

## Current Status

The app is **running and accessible** on the development server. Basic infrastructure tests pass, but full functionality testing requires:

1. A Nostr browser extension for authentication
2. Active relay connections
3. Test accounts with appropriate permissions
4. Manual interaction to verify user flows

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Follow the comprehensive checklist in `test-results/feature-checklist.md`
2. **Bug Documentation**: Create issues for any problems found
3. **Automated Tests**: Implement Playwright tests for critical user flows
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure load times and relay response times
5. **Security Audit**: Review key handling and encryption implementation

**Note**: The app appears to be functioning correctly at the infrastructure level. The Vite development server is serving all resources properly, and the PWA configuration is in place. Full feature testing requires manual interaction with Nostr-specific functionality.
