# About +chorus

+chorus is a simple, decentralized space for communities to gather, share, and grow — built by the team at [And Other Stuff (AOS)](https://andotherstuff.org/) on the open [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) protocol.

Whether you're organizing a movement, documenting your work, or just looking for a safe space to connect, +chorus helps you create and join groups that reflect your values — without compromising your privacy and no big tech server watching you. If you’re an activist, organizer, artist, or builder looking for a safer, simpler way to gather online, +chorus gives you the tools to do that on your terms.

We give you the keys. You drive the conversation.

## What can you do with +chorus?

- Create your own group and set the tone for your community  
- Post notes and photos — share updates, reflections, or inspiration  
- Join conversations in public communities that align with your work  
- Stay anonymous or show up with intention — use a pseudonym, stay private, or bring your existing Nostr identity  
- Use it on the go — fast, lightweight, and mobile-ready  
- Crowdfund your cause through community-driven micropayments using eCash via the [Cashu](https://cashu.space/) protocol
- Support the voices you believe in — pay fellow contributors, reward organizers, fund projects
- Receive support for your own work, activism, or ideas from a like-minded community

## About And Other Stuff (AOS)

[And Other Stuff (AOS)](https://andotherstuff.org/) is the team behind +chorus.

We build open-source tools that help people connect, organize, and collaborate — especially for communities that need more flexible, trustworthy options. Our purpose is to support the development of open-source infrastructure, tooling, products, and related initiatives in the Nostr ecosystem that expand human agency, connection, and productivity.

By focusing on practical, composable apps and shared infrastructure, we’re helping [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) grow from an experimental protocol into a sustainable, widely adopted ecosystem — through collaboration, contribution, and community support.
