# Nostr Client Application with Task Management

## Overview
This project aims to create a modern Nostr client application with integrated task management features. The application will be built using React 18.x, TailwindCSS 3.x, Vite, shadcn/ui components, and Nostrify for Nostr protocol integration.

## Core Features

### 1. Nostr Integration
- Implement Nostr protocol integration using Nostrify
- Support multiple relay connections
- Handle event publishing and subscription
- Implement NIP-07 compliant authentication

### 2. User Authentication
- Support login with Nostr extension (NIP-07)
- Display user profile information
- Allow account switching
- Implement secure session management

### 3. Task Management
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Support task categorization and prioritization
- Enable task dependencies and subtasks
- Implement task status tracking
- Add task descriptions and comments

### 4. User Interface
- Implement responsive design using TailwindCSS
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
- Create intuitive navigation and layout
- Add loading states and error handling
- Implement toast notifications for user feedback

### 5. Data Management
- Implement efficient data fetching with TanStack Query
- Handle Nostr event caching
- Manage application state
- Implement optimistic updates

### 6. Performance & Security
- Optimize bundle size and loading performance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Follow security best practices for Nostr integration
